The magnitude of the induced voltage is proportional to the rate of \nchange of the flux linkages. This finding forms the basis for many magneto electric \nmachin es \n The earliest use of this phenomenon was in the development of induction coils. \nThese coils were used to generate high voltage pulses to ignite the explosive charges in the \nmines. As the d.c. power system was in use at that time, very little of transformer principle \nwas made use of. In the d.c. supply system the generating station and the load center have \nto be necessarily close to each other due to the requirement of economic transmission of \npower. \n Transformers can link two or more electric circuits. In its simple form two electric \ncircuits can be linked by a magnetic circuit, one of the electric coils is used for the creation \nof a time varying magnetic field. The second coil which is made to link this field has a \ninduced voltage in the same. The magnitude of the induced emf is decided by the number of \nturns used in each coil. Thus the voltage level can be increased or decreased by changing \nwww.getmyuni.com\n", "page": 1, "source": "transformers.pdf"}, {"text": " \nPage 6 the number of turns. This excitation winding is called a primary and the output winding is \ncalled a secondary. As a magnetic medium forms the link between the primary and the \nsecondary windings there is no conductive connection between the two electric circuits. The \ntransformer thus provides an electric isolation between the two circuits. The frequency on \nthe two sides will be the same. As there is no change in the nature of the power, the re \nsulting machine is called a \u2017transformer\u2018 and not a \u2017converter\u2018. The electric power at one  \nVoltage/current level is only \u2017transformed\u2018 into electric power, at the same frequency, t o \nanother voltage/current level. \n Even though most of the large-power transformers can be found in the power \nsystems, the use of the transformers is not limited to the power systems. The use of the \nprinciple of transformers is universal. Transformers can be found operating in the frequency \nrange starting from a few hertz going up to several mega hertz. Power ratings vary from a \nfew miliwatts to several hundreds of megawatts. The use of the transformers is so wide \nspread that it is virtually impossible to think of a large power system without transformers. \nDemand on electric power generation doubles every decade in a developing country. For \nevery MVA of generation the installed capacity of transformers grows by about 7MVA.  \nClassification of Transformer:  \n The transformers are classified according to: \n1.

Primary and secondary windings have no resistance.  \n \n2. All the flux produced by the primary links the secondary winding i.e., there is no \nleakage flux.  \n \n3. Permeability \u03bc r of the core is infinitely large. In other words, to establish flux in the \ncore vanishingly small (or zero) current is required.  \n \n4. Core loss comprising of eddy current and hysteresis losses are neglected.  \nConstruction of a Transformer  \nThere are two basic parts of a transformer: \n1. Magnetic core \n2. Winding or coils \n \n\uf0b7 MAGNETIC CORE: The core of a transformer is either square orrectangular in size. \nIt is further divided in two parts.
